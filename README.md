# 🌸 Ferns and Petals Sales Analysis Dashboard 📊

## 1. 🎯 The Goal
The goal of this project was to build a clear, interactive Excel dashboard that helps understand the sales performance of Ferns and Petals (FNP).  
The dashboard gives a full view on orders, revenue, product performance, delivery time, and customer behavior — all inside one simple, easy-to-read report.

This is a complete end-to-end data project using Excel: from cleaning and transforming the data to building a final dashboard using Pivot Tables, Power Query, and DAX in Power Pivot.

## 2. ❓ The Problem
The business needed a better way to understand their sales. Working through raw spreadsheets was slow and confusing, so the dashboard was created to answer important questions like:

- How much revenue are we making?  
- Which products and occasions are performing best?  
- What are the monthly sales trends?  
- How long does delivery take on average?  
- What locations and hours generate the most orders?  

The goal was simple: turn raw data into business insights that can help improve decisions and customer experience.
